# In-process Lake workspace loading

In-process Lake workspace loading for checker discovery. A checked project
loads through Lake's own elaborated package model, so `lakefile.lean` and
`lakefile.toml` projects take the same path; no custom Lake facets or
source-format guesses participate. Load failures fail closed.

to `action`, after refusing a root package that declares a dependency. For a root that declares
none, `Lake.loadWorkspace` loads no other package, so `action` gets the packages that
`withRootWorkspace` gives it. The compiled code of this function calls no loader that resolves or
materializes a dependency, which removes directories (`Regula.Removal.rawRemovals`).

Its prerequisite: before the loader runs, it refuses when `.lake`, `.lake/config` or the directory
of the root package's compiled configuration below the checkout (`Lake.LoadConfig.configDir`,
`.lake/config/0`) is there and is not a directory at its own place
(`Regula.Removal.requireOwnDirectory`). The loader removes and writes files in that directory
(`Lake/Load/Lean/Elab.lean:244`), so with this check they are the checkout's own. -/

/-! ## Builds without Lake's artifact cache

A module that Lake restores from its artifact cache gets a trace with an empty log, so a build
that restores it reports none of its warnings, and the warning-free build check (RG2003) would
pass it. A checker build therefore runs on `uncachedWorkspace`, where no package reads or writes
the cache, after `dropRestoredTraces`, so no root-package module keeps a restored trace. It also
requests the artifacts of each module of the claimed targets it builds, whose traces must then
record an elaboration (`elaborationTrace`). -/
